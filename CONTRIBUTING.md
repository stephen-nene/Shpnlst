**Instructions for Contributing**

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Fork the repository to your own GitHub account by clicking on the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page.

2. **Clone Your Fork Locally**  
   After forking, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

3. **Make Necessary Changes**  
   Create a new branch to work on your changes:
```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
   Make the necessary code changes, enhancements, or fixes.

4. **Commit Your Changes**  
   Ensure that your commits are clear and descriptive. Use the following command to stage and commit your changes:
```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Description of changes"
```

5. **Push Your Changes**  
   Push the changes back to your forked repository on GitHub:
```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
```

6. **Create a Pull Request**  
   Once you've pushed your changes, go to your forked repository on GitHub, and submit a pull request (PR) to the original repository. Provide a brief but clear description of your changes.

7. **Wait for Review**  
   After submitting your PR, the repository maintainers will review your changes. Be patient while they assess the modifications. They may request additional changes.

**Optional**:  
It is recommended (though not required) to use **Git-flow** for managing your branches and versioning effectively during your development process. You can learn more about Git-flow [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
